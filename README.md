You need to have yadm installed. 

## On OSX 

1. Install homebrew (see https://brew.sh/index.html )
  /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
  
2. Install yadm (see https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/docs/install )
  brew install yadm 
  
3. Run bootstrap 
  yadm bootstrap 
 
Enjoy!
